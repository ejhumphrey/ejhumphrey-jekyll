hi.

I'm a Machine Learning Engineering Manager (aka [Chapter Lead](https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-actual-role-of-chapter-leader-in-Spotify)) at [Spotify](http://spotify.com), where I help teams research and develop machine learning algorithms to improve the experience of ad-supported listeners around the world. Previously, I've also been a Senior Machine Learning Researcher at Spotify; a Research Scientist and Team Lead at MuseAmi (RIP); and a consulting engineer for various music / audio technology companies, working on equally varied challenges.


I received my Ph.D. in Music Technology from NYU working with [Juan P. Bello](https://wp.nyu.edu/jpbello/) in the Music and Audio Research Lab ([MARL](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/marl/
)). In May 2015, I defended my disseration, titled [An Exploration of Deep Learning in Music Informatics](https://github.com/ejhumphrey/dl4mir-dissertation/raw/master/EJHumphrey_DL4MIR_final.pdf). Previously, I received a M.S. in [Music Engineering Technology](https://mue.music.miami.edu/) from the University of Miami, and a B.S. in [Electrical Engineering](http://eng-cs.syr.edu/) from Syracuse University.


I'm acting Secretary of the International Society for Music Information Retrieval ([ISMIR](http://ismir.net)), served as a Program Committee co-chair for [ISMIR2018](http://ismir2018.ismir.net), a mentor in the Women in MIR ([WiMIR](https://wimir.wordpress.com/)) mentoring program, and help coordinate the Northeast Music Informatics Special Interest Group ([NEMISIG](http://nemisig.org)) workshops.


In addition to the (perhaps obvious) topics of computational intelligence, music/audio signal processing, and machine learning, I am deeply interested in lean research philosophy, being a better (servant) leader, career development, and STEAM education.


And, in what little time remains, I'm a songwriter and multi-instrumentalist (guitar, vocals, drums, saxophone, ...), a recreational runner, and an increasingly serious woodworker.
