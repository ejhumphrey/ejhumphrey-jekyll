I'm an engineering manager at Spotify, a recovering researcher who still tinkers on the side, and an occasional musician. I enjoy enabling teams to build things that didn't exist before, figuring out how to make highly uncertain work a little less painful, and learning to help people grow in awesome ways.


### New and Noteworthy

* On behalf of my collaborators, I'm pleased to announce that the [OpenMIC-2018](http://bit.ly/openmic-2018) dataset has been released! Presented at ISMIR2018 in Paris, this release includes the source audio, contributor annotations, and software tooling to make working with the data that much easier.

* After a constructive review cycle, our article titled "An Introduction to Vocal Signal Analysis" has been accepted for publication in the IEEE Signal Processing Magazine's special issue on Music Signal Processing, to be distributed in January 2019. Pre-prints are available on request.

* I'm leading an effort to upgrade the digital footprint of the ISMIR society. If you'd like to contribute, join the [ISMIR Slack community](https://slackpass.io/mircommunity) and find us over [at Github](http://github.com/ismir).
